# FirecREST v2 UI

FirecREST UI is a web application designed to provide essential functionalities for interacting with [FirecREST API v2 backend](https://eth-cscs.github.io/firecrest-v2/).

FirecREST offers a REST API that enables developers to interact with HPC resources such as schedulers, filesystems, and more. Additionally, it provides methods for authentication, authorization, job execution, file-system operations, and access to accounting or status information.

## Features

- A modern web interface built on FirecREST API functionalities.
- A dashboard offering an overview of configured clusters and their statuses.
- A dedicated view for creating and monitoring jobs.
- A file navigator with basic file management functionalities, including upload and download features.

While the FirecREST API empowers users to build complex workflows, a workflow manager is not included in the current web interface implementation.
