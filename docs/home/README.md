# FirecREST v2 UI

FirecREST UI is a web application designed to provide essential functionalities for interacting with a FirecREST API v2 backend.

FirecREST offers a REST API that enables developers to interact with HPC resources such as schedulers, filesystems, and more. Additionally, it provides methods for authentication, authorization, job execution, file-system operations, and access to accounting or status information.
